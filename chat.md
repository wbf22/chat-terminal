That sounds like a well-thought-out plan. Taking the time to address necessary updates such as electrical and radon mitigation before moving on to a roof extension is a responsible approach to home improvement projects. It's important to prioritize safety and essential updates before undertaking more cosmetic or structural changes to your home. 

When you're ready to proceed with the roof extension project, be sure to consult with professionals and obtain any necessary permits to ensure that the work is done safely and in compliance with building codes. Planning ahead and tackling one project at a time will help ensure a successful and well-executed renovation process. 

If you have any more questions or need further assistance in the future, feel free to reach out. Best of luck with your home improvement projects!

Ok sounds good. I probably won't do this for a bit. Probably in a year or two once we've finished updating the electrical and putting in a radon mitigation system

Matching the shingles when extending a roof can be a concern for many homeowners, especially when using standard asphalt shingles. The color, style, and age of the existing shingles can affect the ability to find a perfect match for the new extension. In some cases, it may be challenging to obtain an exact match due to variations in manufacturing processes and weathering effects on older shingles.

One option to address this concern is to check with the manufacturer of the existing shingles to see if they can provide the same shingle type and color for your extension. If the original shingles are no longer available, you may need to consider using a similar style and color from a different manufacturer or choosing a complementary color that blends well with the existing roof.

Alternatively, you could consider re-roofing the entire structure with new shingles to ensure a consistent appearance across the entire roof. This may involve more time and cost but could result in a smoother and more cohesive look for your home.

Before starting the roof extension project, it's recommended to consult with a roofing professional or supplier to discuss your options for matching shingles and to ensure that the new and existing roof components complement each other effectively.

Do you think it would be difficult to get matching shingles? I have standard asphalt shingles

Extending a roof, especially on a point like a gable roof, can be a complex project that requires careful planning and consideration of structural integrity. If you're looking to extend your garage roof out a few feet, it's important to consult with a professional architect or structural engineer to ensure the safety and stability of the extended structure. 

One common approach to extending a roof is to extend the existing walls upward or outward and add additional trusses in line with the existing ones to support the extended roof. The new trusses would need to be properly engineered to support the additional weight and meet local building codes. Additionally, considerations must be made for integrating the new roof extension with the existing roof to ensure proper drainage, ventilation, and aesthetic cohesion.

It's always recommended to consult with a professional to assess the feasibility of your project and to create a detailed plan before proceeding with any roof extension project. Safety should always be the top priority when making structural modifications to a building.

Thanks. Do you know what a good way to extend a roof of a house is? I'm thinking of extending my garage roof out a few feet. This is on the side of the roof that has a point, so I'm wondering if I could extend out the wall and then just add more trusses in line.

There is definitely a vast amount of information available online for both programming and architecture. However, programming is more prevalent in the digital landscape, so it's likely that there is a higher volume of programming-related content compared to architectural content. Programming also has a large and active community of developers who regularly share their knowledge and expertise online through blogs, forums, tutorials, and documentation. That being said, both fields have a wealth of information available online for those looking to learn and explore.

Do you think there's more programming information online than architectural?
