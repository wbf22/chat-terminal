That's an interesting thought. Creating a super general-purpose language that aims to cover a wide range of use cases, from web development to high-performance server programming, would certainly be a challenging task. Such a language would need to strike a balance between flexibility and efficiency, while also addressing the diverse needs of developers working in different domains.

One potential concern with a super general language is the risk of becoming too bulky and complex, as it may need to incorporate a wide range of features and tools to accommodate various use cases. This could lead to a bloated and difficult-to-maintain language that is burdened with unnecessary features and complexities.

On the other hand, focusing on specific domains or use cases allows programming languages to be more streamlined, efficient, and tailored to the needs of developers in those specific areas. Specialized languages can be optimized for performance, productivity, and ease of use, leading to better outcomes for developers working in those domains.

In conclusion, while the idea of a super general-purpose language may be intriguing, it is likely that specialized languages will continue to dominate different areas of programming due to their ability to cater to specific needs more effectively. The key is to choose the right tool for the job based on the requirements of each project or application.

Yeah that's a good point. I wonder if a super general lanuage, like one that could do both web development and high performance servers, would be to bulky and crufty

That's a valid perspective. The process of establishing a standard programming language often involves competition and evolution in the industry. As developers create new languages with innovative features or better capabilities, there can be a natural selection process where the most effective and widely adopted languages rise to the top and become the de facto standards for certain use cases or domains.

However, it's important to recognize that the choice of a programming language often depends on the specific requirements of a project, as different languages have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, a language optimized for web development may not be the best choice for real-time systems, and vice versa. 

Having a diverse ecosystem of programming languages allows developers to choose the tools that best suit their needs and preferences. This competition and variety can drive innovation and progress in the industry, leading to the development of more efficient, powerful, and user-friendly languages over time. In the end, the best programming languages are those that meet the needs of developers and users, and are versatile enough to adapt to changing technology trends and requirements.

I think the current view is like, we'll just see who can make the best one and then that one will become the standard

There are pros and cons to both having fewer programming languages and having more languages available. 

Having fewer programming languages can lead to a more standardized approach to software development, as developers across different projects and organizations can more easily collaborate and share code. It can also make it easier for new developers to learn and master a smaller set of languages, leading to a more efficient and streamlined development process.

On the other hand, having more programming languages allows developers to choose the best tool for the job and to experiment with different approaches to solving problems. More languages can cater to a wider range of use cases and can be tailored to specific domains or industries, leading to more innovative solutions and advancements in technology. 

Ultimately, the diversity of programming languages reflects the diversity of needs and challenges in the software development world. While having fewer languages may bring certain benefits in terms of standardization and efficiency, having more languages fosters creativity and innovation in the field. In conclusion, a balance between having a variety of languages and establishing standards within the industry is key to promoting growth and progress in software development.

There has been a steady increase in the number of programming languages being developed over the years. With the advancement of technology and the increasing demand for specialized applications and tools, new programming languages are being created to address specific needs and challenges.

While some languages may become outdated or less popular over time, the overall trend is towards more diversity and innovation in the programming language landscape. Developers are constantly experimenting with new ideas and approaches, leading to the creation of new languages that offer unique features and capabilities.

However, it is worth noting that not all new languages gain widespread adoption or long-term success. Many factors contribute to the popularity and longevity of a programming language, including its ease of use, performance, community support, and industry relevance. As a result, while there may be an increasing number of languages being developed, only a few will ultimately become widely used and established in the industry.
