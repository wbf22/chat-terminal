2. **Salamanders**: While they belong to the order Caudata, salamanders are also amphibians and share a common ancestor with frogs. They have a more elongated body and a tail throughout their life.

3. **Newts**: A subgroup of salamanders, newts are aquatic or semi-aquatic and share a close evolutionary relationship with frogs.

4. **Caecilians**: These are limbless, burrowing amphibians in the order Gymnophiona. They are more distantly related to frogs but still share a common ancestry within amphibians.
